# _2-Digit-Door-Bell-Counter-using-High-Speed-CMOS-IC-4026-Timer-IC-555_
The project can be used to count the total number of visitors that came while you are out of your home. As the visitor presses the Door Bell Button the counter inside the circuit increments by 1 counting the total number of visitors. The project uses the 4026 high-speed CMOS IC (It is also a decade counter and 7-segment decoder) and most versatile monolithic timing linear integrated circuit IC 555.
